##Prims Algorithm

Step 1: Select a starting vertex  
Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there are fringe vertices  
Step 3: Select an edge 'e' connecting the tree vertex and fringe vertex that has minimum weight  
Step 4: Add the selected edge and the vertex to the minimum spanning tree T  
[END OF LOOP]  
Step 5: EXIT
