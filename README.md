##Prims Algorithm

*Step 1: Select a starting vertex  
*Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there are fringe vertices  
*Step 3: Select an edge 'e' connecting the tree vertex and fringe vertex that has minimum weight  
*Step 4: Add the selected edge and the vertex to the minimum spanning tree T  
[END OF LOOP]  
*Step 5: EXIT

##Analysis


###Kruskals Algorithm

*Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
*Step 2: Pick the smallest edge.
*Step 3: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
*Step 4: If it doesnâ€™t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
*Step 5: Repeat from step 2 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.
